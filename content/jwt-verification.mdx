Learn how to enhance the security of your Python web applications by implementing JWT verification with Auth0, using PyJwt and Cryptography libraries.

## Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) serve as a cornerstone for securing modern web applications, facilitating authentication and authorization processes.
In this guide, we'll delve into the robust authentication mechanisms offered by JWTs and demonstrate their seamless integration with Python applications,
leveraging the power of Auth0, PyJwt, and Cryptography.

## Why JWT Verification Matters

JWTs provide a secure means of transmitting information between parties,
ensuring data integrity and authenticity. By employing JWT verification,
developers can thwart unauthorized access attempts and fortify their application's defenses against malicious actors.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into JWT verification, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Create an Account on Auth0: Sign up for an account on Auth0 to leverage its robust authentication and authorization services.
- Configure an API in Auth0: Set up an API within Auth0 to generate JWTs for authentication purposes.
- Install Required Libraries: Install the PyJwt and Cryptography libraries to facilitate JWT verification in Python.

```python
pip install PyJWT cryptography
```

## Verifying JWTs

To verify a JWT in Python, you'll need to have env variables from your Auth0 domain and audience.

```.env
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=''
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https:''
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=''
```

### Fetching Public Key from Auth0

```python
import requests

def get_public_key(kid):
    # fetch public key from Auth0
    url = f"https://{Config.AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL}/.well-known/jwks.json"
    response = requests.get(url)
    jwks = response.json()
    keys = jwks["keys"]
    for key in keys:
        if key["kid"] == kid:
            return key
    return None
```

### Verifying the Token

```python
import jwt
from jwt.algorithms import RSAAlgorithm

def verify_token(token):
    headers = jwt.get_unverified_header(token)
    kid = headers["kid"]
    key = get_public_key(kid)
    if not key:
        return None
    public_key = RSAAlgorithm.from_jwk(key)
    try:
        decoded_token = jwt.decode(
            token, public_key, algorithms=["RS256"], audience=Config.AUTH0_AUDIENCE
        )
        return decoded_token
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        return None
```

### Implementing Decorator Function for API Authorization

```python
from flask import jsonify,request
import functools

def check_jwt(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        authorization_header = request.headers.get('Authorization')
        if not authorization_header:
            return jsonify({'message': 'Authorization token is missing'}), 401
        parts = authorization_header.split()
        if len(parts) != 2 or parts[0].lower() != 'bearer':
            return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid token format'}), 401

        token = parts[1]

        validated_data = verify_token(token)
        if not validated_data:
            return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid token'}), 401

        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function


@app.route(f'{API_VERSION}/', methods=['GET'])
check_jwt # this checks the jwt token before the function is executed
def hello():
    res = response("Flask server running!", False, [])
    return jsonify(res.get()), 200

```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored the significance of JWT verification in bolstering the security of Python web applications.
By leveraging Auth0 alongside PyJwt and Cryptography, developers can implement robust authentication mechanisms and safeguard their applications against unauthorized access attempts.
Embrace the power of JWT verification to fortify your application's defenses and uphold data integrity in the ever-evolving landscape of web security.
