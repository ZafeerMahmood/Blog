In this article, we will learn how to verify JWTs in Python using Auth0 with PyJwt & Crpytography.

## Introduction

{/* ![JWT]('../images/jwt.png') */}

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, you will need to have the following prerequisites:

- Python installed on your machine
- Auth0 account
- PyJwt & Crpytography libraries installed

## Steps

1. Install the PyJwt & Crpytography libraries:

```bash
pip install pyjwt cryptography
```

2. Create a new Python file and import the required libraries:

```python
import jwt
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
```

3. Define the public key:

```python
public_key = b"""
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAzZz5z5z5z5z5z5z5z5z5
-----END PUBLIC
```

4. Verify the JWT:

```python
def verify_jwt(token):
    try:
        decoded = jwt.decode(token, public_key, algorithms=['RS256'])
        print(decoded)
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        print('Token has expired')
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        print('Invalid token')
```

5. Call the `verify_jwt` function with the JWT token:

```python
token = 'eyJ
verify_jwt(token)
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we learned how to verify JWTs in Python using Auth0 with PyJwt & Crpytography. This is a simple and secure way to verify JWTs in your Python applications.
